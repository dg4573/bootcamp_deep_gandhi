# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Retail investors in India currently face a major informational disadvantage in the derivatives and options markets. While institutional players have access to professional-grade tools such as Bloomberg Terminal, which provide live implied volatility (IV) surfaces, option chain analytics, and advanced risk metrics, retail traders mostly rely on basic broker platforms or scattered websites. This lack of comprehensive, reliable, and customizable analytics makes it difficult for individuals to evaluate fair value, manage risk, and identify trading opportunities in real time.

India’s capital markets—especially in index derivatives like NIFTY and BANKNIFTY—are among the most liquid and deepest in the world, offering significant potential for informed traders. Yet, without access to high-quality data vendors for equities and derivatives, and without tools such as real-time IV surface visualization, skew analysis, and strategy testing environments, retail investors cannot compete effectively. Building a Bloomberg-like platform for Indian markets would democratize access to these insights, enable data-driven decision-making, and enhance the sophistication of retail trading.

## Stakeholder & User
Primary Stakeholders: Retail traders in India who need actionable analytics to trade options efficiently.
Secondary Stakeholders: Brokerage firms and fintech startups looking to provide better tools and analytics for clients.

## Useful Answer & Decision
Deliverable: A suite of analytics tools including IV surfaces, option chain metrics, and strategy testing dashboards.
Decision: Can retail traders leverage these tools to make more informed, risk-adjusted trading decisions?
Metric: Accuracy and timeliness of IV surfaces, usability of dashboards, and measurable improvement in simulated trade outcomes.
Artifact: Interactive visualizations, CSV/JSON data outputs, and a simple analytics dashboard.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Access to NSE and other exchange data feeds is available either via API or licensed data vendors.
- Real-time IV surfaces and historical option prices are required for accuracy.
- Tools must be usable without requiring institutional credentials or Bloomberg subscriptions.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Market data latency or API restrictions may limit real-time analysis.
- Changes in regulations (SEBI or exchange rules) could affect options trading mechanics or data availability.
- Retail users may lack advanced options knowledge, so tools must be educational yet actionable.
