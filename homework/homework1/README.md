# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Retail investors in India currently face a major informational disadvantage in the derivatives and options markets. While institutional players have access to professional-grade tools such as Bloomberg Terminal, which provide live implied volatility (IV) surfaces, option chain analytics, and advanced risk metrics, retail traders mostly rely on basic broker platforms or scattered websites. This lack of comprehensive, reliable, and customizable analytics makes it difficult for individuals to evaluate fair value, manage risk, and identify trading opportunities in real time.

India’s capital markets—especially in index derivatives like NIFTY and BANKNIFTY—are among the most liquid and deepest in the world, offering significant potential for informed traders. Yet, without access to high-quality data vendors for equities and derivatives, and without tools such as real-time IV surface visualization, skew analysis, and strategy testing environments, retail investors cannot compete effectively. Building a Bloomberg-like platform for Indian markets would democratize access to these insights, enable data-driven decision-making, and enhance the sophistication of retail trading.

## Stakeholder & User
- Primary Stakeholder: Retail traders in India who need actionable analytics to trade options efficiently.
- Secondary Stakeholders: Brokerage firms and fintech startups providing tools and analytics for clients.
- Timing & Workflow Context: Traders need daily/real-time access for decision-making; brokers use outputs to enrich client dashboards.

## Useful Answer & Decision
- Type: Descriptive + Predictive analytics.
- Metric: Accuracy and timeliness of IV surfaces, skew metrics, and backtested strategy performance.
- Artifact: Interactive visualizations, CSV/JSON outputs, and a simple analytics dashboard.
- Decision: Can retail traders leverage these tools to make more informed, risk-adjusted trading decisions?

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Access to NSE and other exchange data feeds is available via API or licensed vendors.
- Real-time IV surfaces and historical option prices are required for accurate modeling.
- Tools must be usable without institutional credentials or Bloomberg subscriptions.
- Compliance with SEBI regulations at all times.
- Platform latency must allow near real-time decision-making.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Market data latency or API restrictions may limit real-time analysis.
- Changes in SEBI regulations could impact options trading mechanics or data access.
- Retail users may lack advanced options knowledge; platform must balance sophistication with usability.
- Model outputs may diverge from live market behavior due to liquidity or slippage.
