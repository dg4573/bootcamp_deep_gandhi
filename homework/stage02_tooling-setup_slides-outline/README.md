# Section 02: Tooling Setup

This repository is the starter scaffold for my FE bootcamp project work. It includes a reproducible Python environment, folder structure for data, notebooks, and source code, and a .env configuration for managing secrets. A sample Jupyter notebook verifies the setup by loading environment variables and running a basic NumPy operation.
